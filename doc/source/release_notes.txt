       FIXED: Document dms-posre better.

1.5.11 NEW: Slightly optimized within selections.
       FIXED: dms-alchemical for noncontiguous alchemical ranges.

1.5.8  NEW: dms-fix-mass for fixing inconsitent masses.
       NEW: dms-find-knot for finding bonds passing through rings.
       NEW: dms-validate runs the knot check.
       FIXED: dms-alchemical handles alchemical_improper_harm .

1.5.7  FIXED: dms-alchemical was confused by extra properties in the B state.

1.5.6  FIXED: Memory leak in setPositions and setVelocities.

1.5.5  NEW: {get,set}Positions is ~100x faster due to NumPy integration.
       NEW: {get,set}Velocities is ~500x faster due to NumPy integration.
       NEW: System.center and Residue.center use NumPy.
       NEW: Low-level SystemPtr positions and velocities accessors take
            optional ids argument to get/set values for specified atoms.
       NEW: C++ interface for TermTable provides iterator for efficiency.

1.5.4  FIXED: SaveMAE reports error on failure.

       FIXED: Better error messages when accessing nonexistent Term properties.
       NEW: Added getPositions(), getVelocities(), and getCell() to System.

1.5.0  REMOVED: dms-neutralize, dms-solvate
       REMOVED: Undocumented "builder" module.
       FIXED: Documentation for dms-override-vdw, dms-scale-vdw
       NEW: dms-frame tool for extracting coordinates and doing periodic fix.
       NEW: C++ interface for guessing file type.

1.4.8  NEW dms-frame script for frame extraction with centering and wrapping.

1.4.7  NEW: ParamTable::find and TermTable::find{WithAny,WithAll,Exact}.
       NEW: msys.SavePDB.
       NEW: better logging in dms-override-vdw and dms-scale-vdw.
       FIXED: reading of alchemical dms files.
       FIXED: LoadPDB now uses correct chain/segid logic.
       FIXED: dms-dump prints nonbonded_combined information.

1.4.6  Portability (build without C++0x, and on OS X).

1.4.5  Renamed dms-scale-vdw --scale option to --scale-sigma and added
       --scale-epsilon.

1.4.4  Add minimal build configuration options.
       DMS import no longer panics on empty particle table.

1.4.3  Added dms-scale-vdw.

1.4.2  Make ImportDMS thread-safe.

1.4.1  Another way to handle nonbonded_combined_param tables.  We now
       store the 2d table directly, so that we don't choke on systems
       whose entire vdw table has overrides.  API changes at the Python
       and C++ level; dms-override-vdw is unchanged.

1.4.0  The nonbonded_combined_param is now loaded into a TermTable
       called nonbonded_combined which has a new category called override.
       No change to the dms representation, but code that uses msys must
       use the new API in override.hxx to handle vdw overrides.

       The clone() method now copies provenance.

       Reimplemented dms-combine-vdw correctly and renamed it to
       dms-override-vdw.

1.3.7  Hide functions that can conflict with other shared libraries.

1.3.6  Added executable path to provenance.

1.3.5  Internal changes to facilitate inclusion in larger builds.

1.3.4  DEPRECATED: dms-neutralize, dms-solvate.
       Fixed typo in dms-neutralize.
       Fixed equality checks between msys handles of different type.
       Fixed hashing of Term and Param handles.
       Fixed dms-dump nonbonded output for nonbonded param.
       mae2dms and dms2mae now try to preserve ffio_vdwtype names.

1.3.3  Added dms-combine-vdw.

1.3.2  Using 73-Desmond modules.

1.3.1  Fix ImportMAE handling of virtuals (broken in 1.3.0).
       Turn off type checking of particle and bond tables.
       Fix GuessAtomicNumber (affects ReadParmTop only).

1.3.0  Alchemical terms now appear in their own TermTable, and the paramB
       interfaces have been removed.

       Alchemical particles are now listed in an "alchemical_nonbonded" table;
       the chargeB, moiety, and alchemical properties have been removed.

       Alchemical particles can have arbitrary term properties, including
       "chargeC".

       Msys can now detect sharing of parameters by TermTables that share
       a ParamTable, not just within a single TermTable.

1.2.5  Export/import formal_charge to/from dms.

1.2.4  Avoid exporting std::vector of primitive types to python.
       Prmtop import bugfix for when torsions contain negative force constants

1.2.3  Export version info to python.

1.2.2  Module file now adds the -lmsys to DESRES_MODULE_LDLIBS

1.2.1  Much improved support for glue, including in clone() and append()
       operations.  The glue table has been renamed to msys_glue, though
       msys will still read from both tables and merge the two.

       dms-thermalize: the random seed is now 1 by default so that results
       are reproducible.

1.2.0  segid is now a property of Chain.
       New tools: dms-set and dms-macro

1.1.1  dms-neutralize: fix for positive solute charge (DESRESCode#1352)
       dms-neutralize: remove ions if needed to achieve specified concentration
       Fix bug in atom selections on systems with deleted atoms

1.1.0  Added user-defined atom selection macros.
       New atom selection documentation.
       Bumped the minor version since selection macros are visible in the
       dms file.

1.0.13 Disambiguate residues by segid (DESRESCode#1345,1346)

1.0.12 dms-builder fixes

1.0.11 Fixed a memory corruption bug in the dms reading code.

1.0.10 neutralize: set the residue name of ions equal to the atom name.
       builder: preliminary support for charmm36.
       builder: guess atom type based on name if not provided in top file.

1.0.9  msys.Load() supports .maeff and .maeff.gz now.
       Documentation for DMS files converted from Desmond documentation.
       dms-validate --desmond to check for bonds between nonbonded atoms.

1.0.8  gzipped dms files are detected and handled automatically.
       Added msys.Load() for guessing file type from filename.
       dms-info works now on dms, mae, and prmtop files.
       Documentation for dms-validate.

1.0.7  Support for importing Amber prmtop and crd files.
       Update fastjson dependency.
       Documentation fixes.

1.0.6  Anton version: aligning dependencies with treetop/43-Anton.
       Blame scarpazz.

1.0.5  System.positions property.

1.0.4  Typo in dms-validate.

1.0.3  Bugfix: clone() and append() did not copy auxiliary tables (e.g. cmap).

1.0.2  Internal: fix symbol conflicts with other packages.

1.0.1  Documentation updates.
       Added dms-posre.

1.0.0  First stable release.
