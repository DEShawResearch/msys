The Msys library
################

Msys is a library for inspecting and manipulating chemical structures of
the sort used in molecular simulations.  Its main features include:

 * A hierarchical organization of structure information, as opposed to the
   flat tables typically used in molecular file formats;

 * A powerful VMD-like atom selection language;

 * Representation of molecular forcefields which supports sharing of
   parameters by many groups of terms;

 * Conversion to and from many chemical file formats, with forcefield
   and chemical information preserved where possible;

 * Command line tools for scripting common tasks;

 * C++ and Python interfaces.
