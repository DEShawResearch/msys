DESRES tools use the following scheme when parsing dms files.

The DESRES library called msys organizes chemical system into
a hierarchical structure.  The hierarchy has the following names: ct,
chain, residue, atom.  Rows in the particle table of a dms file are mapped
into these four structural levels according to one or more columns in
the particle table.  The relevant columns for each structural level are:

    structure   columns
    ---------   -------
    ct          msys_ct
    chain       chain,segid
    residue     resname,resid,insertion
    atom        id

Of these columns, only the id column is required.  The id will be
contiguous and start at 0.  The id determines the order of the particles
in the structure, important when dealing with simulation trajectories.
The other columns are treated as 0/empty string if not present.

Particles are mapped to ct object according to their msys_ct value.
Within a ct, there will be one chain object for each distinct
(chain,segid) tuple.  Within a chain object, there will be one residue
object for each distinct (resname,resid,insertion) tuple.  For example,
in the following hypothetical particle table with most columns elided:

id  chain   resid   
--  -----   -----
0   A       1
1   A       1
2   B       1
3   C       2
4   B       2

there would be one ct containing three chains with 1, 2, and 1 residues
in chains A, B and C, respectively.  Residues A/1, B/1, B/2, and C/2
would contain atoms 0-1, 2, 3 and 4.

The other columns in the particle table (other than nbtype, which will
be described below) are additional particle properties.  A few are common
enough to be treated specially by our tools:

    column          type    meaning     unit
    ------          ----    -------     ----
    x               float   X position  Angstroms
    y               float   Y position  Angstroms
    z               float   Z position  Angstroms
    vx              float   X velocity  Angstroms/ps
    vy              float   Y velocity  Angstroms/ps
    vz              float   Z velocity  Angstroms/ps
    mass            float   mass        amu
    charge          float   partial chg e
    anum            integer atomic no   integral
    formal_charge   integer formal chg  e
    name            string  

Other columns are often present as well and constitute additional
particle properties, used in simulation and analysis. 

The 'nbtype' column is relevant for forcefield.  If present, it
corresponds to an id in the 'nonbonded_param' table.
