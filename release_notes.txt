1.3.0  Alchemical terms now appear in their own TermTable, and the paramB
       interfaces have been removed.
       
       Alchemical particles are now listed in an "alchemical_nonbonded" table;
       the chargeB, moiety, and alchemical properties have been removed.

       Alchemical particles can have arbitrary term properties, including
       "chargeC".

       a ParamTable, not just within a single TermTable.

       operations.  The glue table has been renamed to msys_glue, though
       msys will still read from both tables and merge the two.

       are reproducible.  

1.2.0  segid is now a property of Chain.
