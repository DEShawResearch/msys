1.4.1  Another way to handle nonbonded_combined_param tables.  We now
       store the 2d table directly, so that we don't choke on systems
       whose entire vdw table has overrides.  API changes at the Python
       and C++ level; dms-override-vdw is unchanged.

1.4.0  The nonbonded_combined_param is now loaded into a TermTable
       called nonbonded_combined which has a new category called override.
       No change to the dms representation, but code that uses msys must
       use the new API in override.hxx to handle vdw overrides.

       The clone() method now copies provenance.

       dms-override-vdw.

       Turn off type checking of particle and bond tables.
       Fix GuessAtomicNumber (affects ReadParmTop only).

1.3.0  Alchemical terms now appear in their own TermTable, and the paramB
       interfaces have been removed.
       
       Alchemical particles are now listed in an "alchemical_nonbonded" table;
       the chargeB, moiety, and alchemical properties have been removed.

       Alchemical particles can have arbitrary term properties, including
       "chargeC".

       Msys can now detect sharing of parameters by TermTables that share
       a ParamTable, not just within a single TermTable.

1.2.5  Export/import formal_charge to/from dms.

1.2.4  Avoid exporting std::vector of primitive types to python.
       Prmtop import bugfix for when torsions contain negative force constants

1.2.3  Export version info to python.

1.2.2  Module file now adds the -lmsys to DESRES_MODULE_LDLIBS

1.2.1  Much improved support for glue, including in clone() and append()
       operations.  The glue table has been renamed to msys_glue, though
       msys will still read from both tables and merge the two.

       dms-thermalize: the random seed is now 1 by default so that results
       are reproducible.  

1.2.0  segid is now a property of Chain.  
       New tools: dms-set and dms-macro

1.1.1  dms-neutralize: fix for positive solute charge (DESRESCode#1352)
